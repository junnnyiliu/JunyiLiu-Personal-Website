# JunyiLiu-Personal-Website

Congratulations on finishing your first web project! I can see that your repo is well-structured and the website has a lot of useful information about you. There are some aspects that could be improved though: 1. You can put more information in the readme file, 2. It seems the page is not deployed yet. You should try to do it, just some simple steps on Github, 3. name the main page as index.html. It's just like a default to do so.
